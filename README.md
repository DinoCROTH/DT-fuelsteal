# DT-stealfuel
Heavily modified mt-stealfuel with added refuling option.
This script allows players to steal fuel from vehicles by using empty jerry cans,
and then refuel other vehicles using filled jerry cans. The process involves
animations and progress bars to enhance realism and requires specific items for each action.
